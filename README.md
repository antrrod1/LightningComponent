Press Ctrl + Shift + P.
Select SFDX: Authorize an Org.
Choose the org type (e.g., Production or use the Project Default defined in sfdx-project.json).

This will pull all components from the org into your local project.

‚úÖ Post-Installation Steps
Step 1: Enable Change Data Capture for Quote
Navigate to Setup in Salesforce.
In the Quick Find box, type "Change Data Capture".
Click Change Data Capture under the Integrations section.
In the list of available entities, find and select:
Quote
Click Save.
‚ö†Ô∏è Important: This is required to publish QuoteChangeEvent notifications. Without this step, real-time quote updates will not be delivered to subscribed clients.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Why This Step is Required
Due to Salesforce platform limitations, Change Data Capture for standard objects like Quote cannot be included in managed packages. This configuration must be set by an admin in the target org.
